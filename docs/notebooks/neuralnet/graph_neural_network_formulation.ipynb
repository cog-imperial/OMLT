    "# Optimizing over trained graph neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains how OMLT is used to optimize over trained graph neural networks (GNNs).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For simplicity, we skip the training process and just use random parameters for GNNs.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Library Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you have a working PyTorch environment to define a Dense NN. This Dense NN is then formulated in Pyomo using OMLT which therefore requires working Pyomo and OMLT installations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The required Python libraries used in this notebook are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `numpy`: used for transformation of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- `torch`: the machine learning language used for neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- `torch_geometric`: the machine learning language used for graph neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pyomo`: the algebraic modeling language for Python, it is used to define the optimization model passed to the solver\n",
    "\n",
    "- `onnx`: used to express trained neural network models\n",
    "\n",
    "- `omlt`: the package this notebook demonstrates. OMLT can formulate machine learning (such as neural networks) within Pyomo\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This notebook also assumes you have a working MIP solver executable to solve optimization problems in Pyomo. The open-source solver CBC is called by default. \n",
